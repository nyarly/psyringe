TODO:

	- Add CircleCI build
	- Add Coveralls build
	- Add GoDoc link
	- Add examples for: New, Add, Clone, Inject

	- Make injection more efficient.
	  (The benchmarks imply this is relatively expensive still, may be
      worth caching injection plan per target type, for use in cloned
      Psyringes.)
	- Find other benchmarks to compare with
	- Add debugging mode to detect goroutine leaks?

	- Add HTTP server example
	
	- Add Even Lazier TM injection using struct func fields.
	- Never add tags! Never!
